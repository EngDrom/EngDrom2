# WebDrom Project

This project is maintained by FoodRegister and has the following goals :
 - Graph Management with a custom editor
 - HTML / CSS / JS Generation to generate a frontend from a design
   - Vanilla JS
   - React JS
   - Molyb JS
 - Python Generation to generate a backend from a graph related database
   - Only Django will be supported

In general, this project is due to become the way FoodRegister will handle backend and frontend relationships in the near and probably far future to allow creation of difficult projects in a few moments with an insane testing behind it.
